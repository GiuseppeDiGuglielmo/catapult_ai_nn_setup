# Create Python Virtual Env for Catapult AI NN

A Python virtual environment is usually created only once, the first time you run a Catapult AI NN project. The environment will be placed in your home `$HOME/ccs_venv`. On some Linux distributions, Catapult's scripts may fail. This repo tries to address some of those issues.

The scripts in this repository create a distro-customized Python virtual environment for Catapult AI NN (`ccs_venv`). Each directory in this repo provides scripts for the associated release of Catapult. Some directories come with multiple configuration files to support different Linux distros.
